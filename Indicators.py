Indicators library

In this library, a set of indicator functions are defined in order to be called at the pre-processing stage of the
discovery algorithm training engine.

All the functions should receive a chunk of size LxNxM and return just a 2D tensor (N, M). The main idea is collapsing
the time-dimension in order to feed the result to a discovery algorithm.
